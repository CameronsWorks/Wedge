# Wedge

Adds The Wedge — the Black Division "Icebreaker" boss from EFT 1.0.5 — and his guard squad to most maps.
He turns up in his own kit and comes looking for you.

## What it adds

A genuinely new boss rather than a reskin. Spiritus LV-119 plate carrier, Team Wendy EXFIL, L3Harris
PVS-31A night vision, an Avon M53A1 gas mask, and his weapons: SCAR-H, SA58, MDR or MP7, a USP .45, and a
SOG tomahawk. Gear spawns at near-perfect durability and he carries roughly twice a PMC's health.

The brain is the part worth caring about. He pushes toward the nearest player instead of holding a corner,
opens with flash and smoke on the approach, and hands the actual gunfight off to SAIN so he still shoots
like something you know how to read. His Black Division Operator escort spawns in the same zone and rushes
with him, so you get the squad arriving together rather than trickling in.

## Spawn chance

Scales with level: 10% at 15, another 5% every 5 levels, capped at 25%. Level 20 is 15%, level 30 and up is
25%. Solo that's your level; in a Fika session it averages everyone who has pinged the server in the last
15 minutes, so one high-level player doesn't drag the lobby's odds up alone.

## Install

Extract into your SPT folder — the one holding `SPT.Server.exe` and `BepInEx`. Merge `user` and `BepInEx`
when Windows asks, then restart the server.

## Requires

- **MoreBotsAPI** — supplies the custom boss role. Without it there's no role to spawn him into.
- **WTT-ContentBackport** — his gear and appearance.
- **DrakiaXYZ-BigBrain** — hard dependency for the rush layer.

Optional: **SAIN** (found by reflection, no assembly reference — without it he still spawns and rushes, he
just fights on the vanilla brain) and **Fika** for co-op. A missing dependency logs a warning instead of
crashing you out.

## Config

`user/mods/Wedge/config.jsonc`, server restart to apply:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `levelScaling` | true | Off falls back to `flatChance` |
| `baseLevel` / `baseChance` | 15 / 10 | Curve start |
| `chancePerStep` / `stepLevels` | 5 / 5 | +5% per 5 levels |
| `chanceCap` | 25 | Ceiling |
| `flatChance` | 15 | Only used with scaling off |
| `groupScaling` | true | Co-op: average the session instead of the host alone |
| `groupWindowMinutes` | 15 | How recent a ping counts toward that average |
| `escortAmount` | 3 | Guards |
| `singleZone` | true | Keeps him and the escort arriving together |
| `enabledMaps` | 13 maps | Reserve, Streets, Customs, both Factories, Interchange, Labs, Lighthouse, both Ground Zero tiers, Shoreline, Woods, Labyrinth. Delete an entry to switch a map off. |

F12, section *Wedge*: Enable, Aggressive Rush, Grenade Barrage, Rush Radius (caps how far he'll chase so he
doesn't sprint the map from spawn), and Layer Priority. Leave Layer Priority alone unless you know what
you're doing — it has to stay below SAIN's combat layers at 20+ or he'll rush while he should be shooting.

## Build

`dotnet build -c Release` with the .NET SDK 8+. Three projects: `Client`, `Prepatch`, `Server`. `SptRoot` in
each csproj resolves the SPT install; override it if your checkout isn't three folders down.

Built against SPT 4.0.13 / EFT 0.16.9.
